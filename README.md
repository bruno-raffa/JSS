# Job Shop Scheduling

Job shop scheduling is an optimization problem where the goal is to schedule jobs on a certain number of machines according to a process order for each job. The objective is to minimize the length of schedule also called make-span, or completion time of the last task of all jobs. The challenge is tackled on D-wave using a CQM (https://github.com/dwave-examples/job-shop-scheduling-cqm).

This is a readaptation into a Jupyter notebook.
